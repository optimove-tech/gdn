Add the [Web SDK](https://github.com/optimoveproductintegration/Web-SDK-Integration-Guide) functions into your code with the details the Product Integration team sent you:

 1. Call [`optimoveSDK.initialize()`](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Web-SDK-Integration-Guide#add-code) function to initialize the SDK
 2. Call [`optimoveSDK.API.setPageVisit()`](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Web-SDK-Integration-Guide#track-visits) function to report page visits
 3. Call [`optimoveSDK.API.setUserId()`](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Web-SDK-Integration-Guide#link-visit-customer) or [`optimoveSDK.API.registerUser()`](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Web-SDK-Integration-Guide#record-user-email) in order to link/stitch visitor to customerID for Optimove campaigns
>**Notes:** 
> - Please contact the Product Integration Team to guide you on which functions to use
> - Use the [Web SDK](https://github.com/optimoveproductintegration/Web-SDK-Integration-Guide) guide to see detailed information on the above functions

>**Technical explanation:** 
> - The functions above sets a cookie for each site visitor containing your Customer ID or Visitor ID, under the Google Cookie Matching service domain. 
> - It also sends a pixel request to the specified Google domain, receiving in return a redirect request to the Optimoveâ€™s cookie matching service, containing the Google ID of the customer. 
> - This allows Optimove to match the Google ID received with your existing Customer ID or assigned Visitor ID, thus identifying the customer/visitor within the Optimove data warehouse.
